This will be a interesting matchup where bothe teams are representing the LPL. This will be tough for Suning because Top Esports has shown domination in the region all year,it will be like uphill battle for Suning. Top Esports has qualified for semifinals with hard competition at a moment its looks like they could not beat Fnatic but they have managed to win at last match. On the other hand Suning looks stronger they had defeated the JD Gaming by 3-1.Top Esports is the audience favorite team on the other hand you can not ignore Suning who accomplished the popularity by performance in Worlds2020. In Top Esports, team fighting ability of JackeyLove had helped greatly to the team in game and won the three big the series. Its clear Suning will need to eliminate JackeyLove and Karsa from team fights as early as they can. Top Esports must take down the Suning’s top laner Chen”Bin” Ze-Bun and Tang “huanfeng”Huan-Feng earlier beacuse they might create the problem for Top Esports.
</p><p>
•DAMWON Gaming vs G2 Esports
</p><p>
DAMWON Gaming and G2 Esports have come to semifinals from a long paths. G2 Esports had to fight long because DAMWON Gaming has made to semifinals untouched, they had defeated JD Gaming and DRX. DAMWON Gaming is currently fans favourite , they have dominated entire season of 2020 League of Legends World Championship , on the other hand  G2 Esports had surprised the community with 3-0 over Gen.G, they will be a tough competition for the DAMWON Gaming. In my opinion DAMWON Gaming will won the series while gone to the final map. Both teams are the last hope for their regions, G2 Esports are the last hope for the western regions because all other teams failed to continue further. DAMWON Gaming is looking most consistent team at Worlds 2020, their playing and ability to dominate the game are unmatched.

On the other hand Gen.G encounters stronger in the competition of League of Legends Champions Korea 2020. If we keep in mind, the  performance of both teams so far, it will be tough call to predict the winner. It will be depended on the day that who will shows up on the day.
